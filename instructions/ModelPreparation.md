# Model Preparation :
Run one of the following codes in the src directory:
1) [Inception-V3](../Codes/inception_Github.ipynb)
2) [Resnet](../Codes/resnet_Github.ipynb)

## Working
The above codes will use the processed data present in the directory "proc_input" and store the expected model in the "output" directory for further use([Generating heatmaps](../Codes/heatmap_Github.ipynb))
